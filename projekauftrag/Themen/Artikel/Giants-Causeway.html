            <p>
              Located on the coast of County Antrim in Northern Ireland, the
              Giant's Causeway is an area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt
              columns, the result of an ancient volcanic fissure eruption. It
              was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tops of the columns form stepping stones that lead from the
              cliff foot and disappear under the sea. Most of the columns are
              hexagonal, although there are also some with four, five, seven or
              eight sides. The tallest are about 12 metres (39 ft) high, and the
              solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 metres (92 ft) thick in
              places.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond the incredible geology, the site is steeped in myth and
              legend. The story goes that the causeway was built by the Irish
              giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn MacCool) as a path to cross the sea
              to fight the Scottish giant Benandonner. This blend of natural
              wonder and folklore makes it a truly captivating destination.
